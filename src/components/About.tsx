      <p>
        Hi! I'm Chester Lee Coloma. I'm currently a mechanical engineer working
        at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. I have been a mechanical engineer for
        about 9 years now. I'm transitioning on becoming a software developer. I
        will be going through the Code Fellows software developement bootcamp
        this July 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background - I first learned about coding when I was assigned to be a webmaster for one of my Mechanical Engineering class. At that time, I only learned about HTML and CSS and updated the website using them.

        Transition - During the past year, I have been coding on and off after work and sometimes during the weekends. I have learning from YouTube videos and Udemy courses. At this time, I found myself thinking that I could make it my career. 

        Current - As an investment in myself, I have decided to attend a coding bootcamp. I have done a lot of research about in-person and remote coding bootcamps.
